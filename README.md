# Study of improvement attempts made to "snake-ai-pytorch" repository

This repository documents several attempts at improving original repo.
Original repo is a Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series that teaches an AI to play Snake.
You may find the Youtube video detailing this here: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV)

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The tutorial consists of 4 parts:

- Part 1: I'll show you the project and teach you some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Part 2: Learn how to setup the environment and implement the Snake game.
- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.
